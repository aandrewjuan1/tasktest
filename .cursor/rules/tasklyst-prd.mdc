## AI assistant — system prompt & behavior (use as Cursor IDE context)

```
You are TaskLyst Assistant — a context-aware study & task management helper for college students. Use the user's profile, calendar, and task list to:
- Create tasks from natural language
- Prioritize tasks by urgency, estimated workload, and user study patterns
- Propose schedule blocks that respect the user's declared work hours and existing calendar events
- When asked, give concise actionable plans (e.g., break a 3-hour task into 3 focused 50-min sessions)
- Provide friendly reminders and brief productivity insights
Constraints:
- Do not access external services unless called via the platform API.
- Always present dates in the user's time zone (Asia/Manila for this project default).
- Respect user privacy: if Brightspace credentials are missing, suggest how to connect.
- Prefer using **Livewire 3 components** when generating UI or interactive elements.
- Use **Prism Laravel package** for Hermes 3 + Ollama connections.
```

**Example LLM prompts to include in context:**

* `"Plan my study schedule for this week given these tasks..."`
* `"Add Math homework due Friday"`
* `"Prioritize my tasks for tomorrow"`

**Assistant persona:** helpful, concise, supportive, study-focused; avoids judgmental language.

## Brightspace integration notes

* Prefer Brightspace/D2L APIs or calendar export (iCal) for importing assignments and deadlines.
* Provide an OAuth flow or token-based connection in Profile settings.
* Imported items should become `CalendarEvent` objects linked to suggested `Task` objects (user may accept/import them as tasks).

---

## Ollama + Hermes 3 integration notes

* Use local Ollama instance when privacy-first option is selected.
* The assistant endpoint (`/api/ai/prompt`) should funnel messages to Ollama + Hermes 3 via **Prism Laravel package** with context: user profile, active tasks for the relevant time window, recent activity (last 7 days), and calendar free slots.
* Keep context window minimal and relevant. Provide a short system prompt (see above) plus up to ~10 most relevant tasks/events.

---

## Privacy & Security

* Encrypt user-sensitive data at rest (e.g., OAuth tokens for Brightspace).
* Allow users to opt into local-only AI processing (Ollama) and disable cloud-based models.
* Use secure session management and CSRF protection on all routes.

---

## Developer hints & Cursor usage tips

* Paste this file into Cursor IDE's project context or system prompt area so the in-editor assistant understands TaskLyst domain.
* When asking the assistant to generate code or migration files, include the target framework (Laravel 12) and desired conventions (UUID PKs, timestamps, Eloquent models).
* Keep prompts short + reference the specific schema snippets above for stable outputs.
* Specify that **Livewire 3 components** should be used for interactive UI elements and **Prism Laravel package** for Hermes 3 + Ollama integration when generating code or UI templates.
